version: 0.4.9
summary: An extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust.
description: |
  Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
  functionality behind a single, common interface.

  - ⚡️ 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black)
  - 🐧 Installable via `snap`
  - 🛠️ `pyproject.toml` support
  - 🤝 Python 3.12 compatibility
  - ⚖️ Drop-in parity with Flake8, isort, and Black
  - 📦 Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
  - 🔧 Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports)
  - 📏 Over 700 built-in rules, with native re-implementations of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
  - ⌨️ First-party editor integrations for VS Code and more
  - 🌎 Monorepo-friendly, with hierarchical and cascading configuration
